# **App Name**: Pocket Achievements

## Core Features:

- Child Profiles: Create individual profiles for each child, including their current age, and assigned monthly allowance. Admin should be able to adjust profiles easily.
- Responsibility Categories: Set up categories for responsibilities (school, family, social, behavioral).
- Task Management: For each category, define specific tasks that need completion to earn some credit towards the overall allowance. Checkboxes allow verification of task completion.
- Progress Tracking: Visually show progress towards allowance earnings using progress bars. A color scale (red to green) could reflect performance, with green being maximal performance.
- Automated Allowance Calculation: Calculate allowance based on completed tasks in each category, automatically adjusting the final payment amount. Configurable weightings can reflect priorities for each category of tasks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(48, 75%, 50%) - A vibrant, friendly gold (#E08A0B) representing the rewards and achievements earned. Gold brings in feelings of accomplishment, maturity and fun, which could inspire children to embrace responsibility.
- Background color: HSL(48, 20%, 95%) - Light beige (#F5F2ED), creates a soft, inviting backdrop that enhances the focus on the content.
- Accent color: HSL(18, 75%, 50%) - A bold orange (#E05A0B) complements the gold while adding energy, ideal for call-to-action buttons and highlighting progress.
- Clean, modern font for readability, with clear hierarchy for child names, tasks, and allowance amounts.
- Use clear and engaging icons for categories and tasks; consider a badge or star icon for completed tasks or achievements.
- The layout should be intuitive with clear sections for each child, easy access to task lists, and prominent display of progress bars.
